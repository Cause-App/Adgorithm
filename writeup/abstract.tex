It is common for free platforms on the internet to use targeted advertising as a revenue stream, but this usually comes at the cost of user privacy. In this paper we propose a method of targeting advertising to users of an online platform without any of their data being collected or accessible. Broadly, this technique combines deep reinforcement learning (to learn user preferences) with cryptography (to prevent others, including the platform administrators, from accessing any private user data). Furthermore, we propose an algorithm which allows multiple platforms to benefit from these learned preferences while still maintaining complete privacy.
